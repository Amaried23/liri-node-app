LIRI is similar to iPhone's SIRI. 

LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node application that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


LIRI displays my latest tweets when prompted for twitter tweets by writing in the command prompt node liri.js "my-tweets" . It sends requests to twitter for data and returns the data within the command line. 

LIRI also displays information about songs from Spotify by sending requests to spotify for specific data when writing liri.js spotify-this-song (enter song name here).

LIRI displays information about movies from OMDB by sending requests to site for specific data using their API when writing in the command line liri.js movie-this (enter movie here).
